# A web application for a feedback from
* Technologies used: Java, H2 Database, Spring Boot, Angular, Lombok

## Setup Guide
* Clone both back-end and front-end projects to your IDE
* Run back-end application by running FeedbackApplication.java and it will run on localhost:8080
    * It will also initialize one feedback.
    * For tests run FeedbackControllerTest.java under test directory.
    * I also added SwaggerConfig so that requests and http methods can be tested without front-end running.
* Run front-end by opening terminal in feedback-frontent/client directory run "npm install" and "ng serve" and it will 
run on localhost:4200.
    * Open web browser and open localhost:4200, proxy configuration is used for it to make requests to back-end
    localhost:8080.
